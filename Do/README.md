# Java project layout

Project layout and quick usage:

- `src/` — Java source files (`*.java`).
- `bin/` — Compiled classes (`*.class`) (generated by scripts/build tools).

Quick commands:

Compile all Java sources into `bin/`:
```bash
./compile.sh
```
or with Makefile:
```bash
make
```

Run a class (example `Q01b`):
```bash
make run CLASS=Q01b
```

Clean compiled classes:
```bash
make clean
```

VS Code: use the `Terminal → Run Task...` menu and select `Compile Java (project)` or `Run Java (project)`.
